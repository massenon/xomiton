# Domain

> DDD modeling: bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, aggregates, events and context contracts.

## Purpose

This folder materializes the mental model of the business: the context map, the ubiquitous language glossary, the aggregates with their invariants, domain events and contracts (ACLs) between bounded contexts. NOT here: technical API contracts (use `02-architecture/api/`) nor implementation (lives in code).

## Subfolders

- `aggregates/` — one file per domain aggregate.
- `events/` — one file per domain event.
- `contracts/` — integration contracts between bounded contexts (ACL, OHS, etc.).

## Artifacts

_No artifacts yet._

## Available templates

- `_templates/context-map.md.tpl` — bounded contexts map.
- `_templates/ubiquitous-language.md.tpl` — glossary of domain terms.
- `_templates/aggregate.md.tpl` — aggregate with invariants and operations.
- `_templates/domain-event.md.tpl` — domain event with payload and consumers.
- `_templates/contract.md.tpl` — contract between contexts.

## Useful wikilinks

- [[CLAUDE]] — vault doctrine
- [[_INDEX]] — global index
