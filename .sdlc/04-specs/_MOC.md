# Specs

> Spec-Driven Development: one folder per feature, with requirements (EARS), design and tasks.

## Purpose

Each feature has a subfolder `<feature>/` containing the canonical trio: `requirements.md` (EARS requirements, testable), `design.md` (feature architecture) and `tasks.md` (executable task list). NOT here: PRDs or epics (use `01-planning/`); stories live as bullets within epics, not as separate files.

## Subfolders

- `<feature>/` — each feature creates its own folder with the three SDD trio files.

## Artifacts

_No artifacts yet._

## Available templates

- `_templates/requirements.md.tpl` — requirements in EARS (`WHEN … THE SYSTEM SHALL …`).
- `_templates/design.md.tpl` — technical design of the feature.
- `_templates/tasks.md.tpl` — executable task list grouped by phase.

## Useful wikilinks

- [[CLAUDE]] — vault doctrine
- [[_INDEX]] — global index
